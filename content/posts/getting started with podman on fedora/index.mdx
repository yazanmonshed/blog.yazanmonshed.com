in this article, we will introduce to podman and how using it with smpile application build using nodejs. the app will be very simple and clean.

[podman](https://podman.io) is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. podman command the same
[docker](https://docker.com) just type in your terminal alias docker=podman if you have docker already installed.



## install Podman

Podman is by default installed in fedora, but if you don’t have it for any reason you can install it across type the following command


```bash
$ sudo dnf install podman
```

for fedora silverblue users podman is already installed in your OS, now you can run hello world image to ensure is everything working Good

```bash
$ podman pull hello-world 
$ podman run hello-world
```

if everything is working well you will show the following output in your terminal

```bash

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
(amd64)
The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
to your terminal.
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

```

## simple Nodejs App

First, we will create a folder webapp , type the following command in your terminal

```bash
mkdir webapp && cd webapp
```

then create file package.json this file includes all dependencies that project need to work well copy the following code inside package.json

```js 

{
       "dependencies": {

               "express": "*"
       },

       "scripts": {


               "start": "node index.js"

       }

}
```
then create file index.js and add the following code here

```js 


app.get('/', (req, res)=> {

       res.send("Hello World!")

});



app.listen(8081, () => {


       console.log("Listing on port 8080");


});
```
you can download the source code from this [here](https://github.com/YazanALMonshed/webapp)

## Create Dockerfile

first of all, create a file called **Dockerfile** make sure the first character is capital, NOT small then add the following code here



```bash 
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR usr/app

COPY ./ ./

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

be sure you inside the folder webapp then show the image and then type the following command


```bash
podman build .
```

make sure to add **dot** and now this image was created in your machine you can show this image by the following command

```bash
podman images
```

and the last step is run the image inside a container, type the following command in your terminal

```bash 
podman run -p 8080:8080 <image-name>
```

and the final step is to open your browser in localhost:8080 and you will see your app works

## Stopping and Remove Container

to exit from container across typing CTR – C and you can remove container by using container id

```bash
podman ps -a

podman stop <container_id>
```

and the last thing you can delete the images from your machine by using the following command

```bash
podman rmi <image_id>
```
